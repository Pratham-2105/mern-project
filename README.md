⚙️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm (v8 or higher recommended)

MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Pratham-2105/mern-project.git
cd mern-project

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and set up environment variables.

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB connection URI:

MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
PORT=5001

Replace YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.

cd ../frontend
npm install

4. Running the Application Locally
Start the Backend
From the backend directory:

npm run dev

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5001.

Start the Frontend
From the frontend directory:

npm run dev

The frontend development server will start on http://localhost:5173.

Your application should now be running locally, and you can access it in your browser at http://localhost:5173.
